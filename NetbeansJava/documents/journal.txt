-- 2015-09-15,19:31 --
+ started resource manager project
+ the windows are laid out using JavaFX
+ established basics for drawing graph

-- 2015-09-21,17:38 --
+ learned how to load a text file in java
+ successfully parsed the resource file, now need to convert it to a graph/tree

-- 2015-09-22,00:03 --
+ resource tree structure established
+ resource file successfully converted to tree
+ listed the whole graph in text form through system output

-- 2015-09-22,20:30 --
+ resource tree structure established
+ deletion of existing nodes tested and it works
+ deletion affects dependencies correctly
+ added usable flags to lookup table
+ usable flags are reset upon deletion and file load
# usable flags are for speeding up isUsable() method
+ integrated graph code with GUI
+ list of nodes displays properly in its designated text frame
+ made methods to graph that easily interface node list, name list, 
  and lookup table in general
+ node deletion integrated with the GUI

-- 2015-09-23,04:04 --
+ colors for active graph display decided: active nodes are red with blue trim,
  usable links are dark cyan with dark blue trim
+ graph now drawn by stepping through graph's node list
+ boxes for resource tree nodes now drawn
+ links between nodes drawn as transparent triangles
# link triangles denote link direction, with small end at dependency
+ color for inactive nodes is gray, as are links for unusable node chains

-- 2015-09-24,17:43 --
+ changed direction of node link triangles; the point now touches the node and 
  the base is at the dependency
+ changed the color of nodes 
  (green=usable, yellow=unusable but active, red=inactive)

-- 2015-09-24,19:06 --
+ list of dependencies for each node shown in node list
+ put a label next to node name input text box telling user what it is
+ canvas changed from 1000x1000 to 1500x1500 to handle larger graphs
+ added way to restore inactive nodes
+ can now add a dependency by specifying node and dependency names - 
  missing nodes are added automatically, just as they are in loading a file

-- 2015-09-25,14:29 --
+ got quit button to trigger program close
+ added means by which one can unlink a node with one of its dependencies
+ drew a legend for the graph display explaining color coding of nodes  
  (green=usable, yellow=unusable but active, red=inactive)
+ max graph columns value is now adjusted to fit within canvas
+ removed window size display (bottom right) and replace it with something else

-- 2015-09-25,14:48 --
+ added button to swap names in node and dependency text boxes

-- 2015-09-26,22:16 --
+ can save a file from the graph data
+ in lookup table, list of flags added to tell if each node has been used in 
  links or active and method to update list added
+ when saving, unused island nodes are skipped 
+ added button to clear graph
+ tested save/load and it works, but some inactive nodes get made active 
  upon reload

-- 2015-09-27,00:48 --
+ added javadocs for methods

-- 2015-09-27,01:36 --
+ added file chooser dialog to chose a file name.

-- 2015-10-20,17:51 --
+ nodes that are not needed by other nodes can be deleted fully now, not just 
  made "inactive";  all referenced indexes in graph are adjusted after delete

-- left to do -- 
- (optional) add javadocs for data
- (optional) add some more features for extra credit
